VoiceXML::Client version 1.00
============================

The VoiceXML::Client library allows you to fetch, parse and interpret VoiceXML files.  

It was developed as a supporting component of the (upcoming version of the) VOCP voice messaging system (http://www.vocpsystem.com).

It's role is to:

	- fetch vxml files
	- parse their contents
	- interpret them by executing the instructions therein

It is not (yet) a complete implementation of the VoiceXML specs, but does support many interesting features.  Have a look at the project website:

For examples and instructions.
